# Project: Designing an Enterprise Data Lake üöÄ
## Aim of the Project üéØ
The aim of this project is to design and implement a Data Lake solution for "Medical Data Processing" Company, which will address the current challenges and limitations of their existing data infrastructure. By transitioning from a traditional monolithic 3-tier application architecture to a scalable, reliable, and efficient Data Lake architecture, the company aims to:

**Improve System Uptime and Reliability:** Ensure continuous availability and fault tolerance of the system, minimizing downtime and risk.

**Enhance Performance and Scalability:** Reduce latency of SQL queries and reports, and enable the architecture to scale with increasing data volume and velocity.

**Increase Business Agility:** Foster innovation through automation and the ability to experiment with new frameworks, thereby improving the speed of business processes.

**Streamline Data Management:** Centralize all enterprise data, enable easy access, and implement a metadata-driven design to process various data types efficiently.

**Enable Advanced Analytics:** Support real-time data processing, machine learning model building, and the creation of near-real-time dashboards without the need to move data across systems.

**Leverage Open Source Tools:** Avoid vendor lock-in by embracing open source tools, ensuring flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

**Facilitate Comprehensive Reporting and Analytics:** Provide interactive querying capabilities, ad-hoc data analytics, and seamless integration with different ML frameworks and visualization tools.

By achieving these objectives, the company can overcome its current data processing limitations and position itself for continued growth and success in the healthcare data insights industry.

## There are 4 deliverables in this project. üèÜ
- Data Lake Solution Architecture Diagram
- Data Lake Architecture Design Template
- A Powerpoint presentation targeted for CXO level audience showcasing Data Lake Value Proposition
- A ~8 minute video recording of your presentation, to the executive leadership of the company, of the Data Lake Value Proposition using the presentation from deliverable #3

*Alright, let's break this down step-by-step to make it simpler:*

### Step 1: Analyze the Use Case
Read the Company Profile and Problem Statement: Understand the company's current situation, challenges, and requirements. This document includes a detailed description, current architecture, problem details, and business/technical requirements.

### Step 2: Create a Data Lake Solution Architecture Diagram
**Ingestion Layer**: Plan how to ingest various types of data.

**Storage Layer**: Decide how to store large amounts of data and leverage NoSQL databases.

**Processing Layer**: Determine how to process large amounts of data at scale and the tools to use.

**Serving Layer**: Plan how to serve the data for applications like ML, reports, and visualization.

Use [Lucidchat](https://www.lucidchart.com/) or similar software to create this diagram. Save it as a PDF named `DataLakeSolutionArchitectureDiagram.PDF`.

### Step 3: Populate the Data Lake Architecture Design Template üìÑ
Embed the Architecture Diagram: Place the PDF from Step 2 into the [DataLakeArchitectureDesign.docxtemplate](https://github.com/Srijana1425/Data-Architect-Big-Data-Project_FinalProject/blob/main/Project_templates/companyprofile-problemstatement-3.docx) (under question #5).

Populate Remaining Sections: Describe your architecture, rationale for design decisions, and how your design solves the company's challenges. State assumptions and potential risks. Ensure technical correctness and include cloud-native tools if relevant.

### Step 4: Create a Presentation for Executives
Use the Powerpoint Template: Use the [DataLakeExecutivePresentation.pptxtemplate](https://github.com/Srijana1425/Data-Architect-Big-Data-Project_FinalProject/blob/main/Project_templates/datalakeexecutivepresentation-starter-1.pptx) to create a presentation.

Focus on the Value Proposition: Explain why a Data Lake is important, what business value it brings, and what problems it can solve. Avoid technical jargon and tool names. Make the presentation visually appealing and easy to understand.

### Step 5: Record Your Presentation üé•
Prepare Your Slides: Use the presentation from Step 4.

Record Your Video: Create a screen + audio recording. Explain your slides clearly and concisely, without reading the content word-for-word. Present effectively and aim to convince the leadership to adopt your proposed design.
