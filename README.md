# Project: Designing an Enterprise Data Lake üöÄ

## There are 4 deliverables in this project. üèÜ
- Data Lake Solution Architecture Diagram
- Data Lake Architecture Design Template
- A Powerpoint presentation targeted for CXO level audience showcasing Data Lake Value Proposition
- A ~8 minute video recording of your presentation, to the executive leadership of the company, of the Data Lake Value Proposition using the presentation from deliverable #3

*Alright, let's break this down step-by-step to make it simpler:*

### Step 1: Analyze the Use Case
Read the Company Profile and Problem Statement: Understand the company's current situation, challenges, and requirements. This document includes a detailed description, current architecture, problem details, and business/technical requirements.

### Step 2: Create a Data Lake Solution Architecture Diagram
**Ingestion Layer**: Plan how to ingest various types of data.

**Storage Layer**: Decide how to store large amounts of data and leverage NoSQL databases.

**Processing Layer**: Determine how to process large amounts of data at scale and the tools to use.

**Serving Layer**: Plan how to serve the data for applications like ML, reports, and visualization.

Use [Lucidchat](https://www.lucidchart.com/) or similar software to create this diagram. Save it as a PDF named `DataLakeSolutionArchitectureDiagram.PDF`.

### Step 3: Populate the Data Lake Architecture Design Template üìÑ
Embed the Architecture Diagram: Place the PDF from Step 2 into the [DataLakeArchitectureDesign.docxtemplate](https://github.com/Srijana1425/Data-Architect-Big-Data-Project_FinalProject/blob/main/Project_templates/companyprofile-problemstatement-3.docx) (under question #5).

Populate Remaining Sections: Describe your architecture, rationale for design decisions, and how your design solves the company's challenges. State assumptions and potential risks. Ensure technical correctness and include cloud-native tools if relevant.

### Step 4: Create a Presentation for Executives
Use the Powerpoint Template: Use the [DataLakeExecutivePresentation.pptxtemplate](https://github.com/Srijana1425/Data-Architect-Big-Data-Project_FinalProject/blob/main/Project_templates/datalakeexecutivepresentation-starter-1.pptx) to create a presentation.

Focus on the Value Proposition: Explain why a Data Lake is important, what business value it brings, and what problems it can solve. Avoid technical jargon and tool names. Make the presentation visually appealing and easy to understand.

### Step 5: Record Your Presentation üé•
Prepare Your Slides: Use the presentation from Step 4.

Record Your Video: Create a screen + audio recording. Explain your slides clearly and concisely, without reading the content word-for-word. Present effectively and aim to convince the leadership to adopt your proposed design.
